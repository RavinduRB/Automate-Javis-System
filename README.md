I'm a fan of the Iron Man movie series and thought of creating Tony Stark's Al assistant javis operating system. I used Python to create it and I am still developing it. I decided to post a demo of my creation on LinkedIn.

If you want, you can get the results related to the command by typing and sending the following codes or by clicking the "Start Voice Recognition" button and saying the command.

ðŸ”¹ open google

ðŸ”¹ open youtube

ðŸ”¹ play song

ðŸ”¹ time

ðŸ”¹ date

ðŸ”¹ calculator

ðŸ”¹ spotify

ðŸ”¹ open vscode

ðŸ”¹ open notepad

ðŸ”¹ lock screen

ðŸ”¹ shutdown

ðŸ”¹ restart

ðŸ”¹ news

The above commands can be customized according to your needs.

### **Summary of Detailed Non-Functional Requirements**

This breakdown offers a deeper view into how the JARVIS-like assistant should perform. Each non-functional requirement has been elaborated with specific targets and considerations, ensuring that the system is not just feature-rich but also robust, secure, scalable, and user-friendly.

These non-functional requirements are essential for ensuring that the assistant not only functions as expected but also delivers a high-quality user experience, remains secure, and is easy to maintain and extend over time.

If you'd like, we can discuss the technical strategies to implement some of these non-functional requirements, such as how to optimize performance or secure sensitive data in a Python-based application. Let me know!

---

Creating a Python-based JARVIS-like assistant with Tkinter and other libraries to meet all these functional and non-functional requirements is a complex project. I'll break down the implementation into manageable components, providing code snippets for different parts of the system.

We will be using a combination of Python libraries such as:
- **SpeechRecognition** for voice recognition
- **pyttsx3** for text-to-speech (TTS)
- **NLTK** or **spaCy** for natural language understanding (NLU)
- **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface
- **OpenCV** for facial recognition
- **smtplib** for email handling
- **Home Assistant** API for smart home integration
- **Requests** for web scraping and information retrieval
- **psutil** for system monitoring
- **deepface** for emotion detection

I'll outline the different components below, and we can proceed with coding the individual modules step by step.

### 1. **Voice Recognition**
We'll use `speech_recognition` to capture the user's voice and listen for a wake word.

```python
import speech_recognition as sr

def recognize_speech_from_mic(recognizer, microphone):
    # Capture audio from the microphone
    with microphone as source:
        print("Listening for commands...")
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)

    # Try to recognize speech using Google's speech recognition
    try:
        response = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        return response.lower()
    except sr.RequestError:
        return "API unavailable"
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        return "Unable to recognize speech"

# Initialize recognizer and microphone
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
mic = sr.Microphone()

while True:
    command = recognize_speech_from_mic(recognizer, mic)
    if "hey jarvis" in command:
        print("Wake word detected! Listening for further commands...")
        # Further processing like converting speech to text
```

### 2. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**
We can use a library like `spaCy` or `NLTK` to handle intent recognition, entity extraction, and context management. Here's a basic setup using `spaCy`.

```python
import spacy

# Load spaCy's language model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def understand_intent(text):
    doc = nlp(text)
    intents = []
    entities = []
    
    # Extract entities
    for ent in doc.ents:
        entities.append((ent.text, ent.label_))

    # Simple intent recognition (expand this for more complex intents)
    if "reminder" in text:
        intents.append("set_reminder")
    elif "email" in text:
        intents.append("send_email")

    return intents, entities

# Example usage
command_text = "Set a meeting with John tomorrow at 3 PM."
intents, entities = understand_intent(command_text)
print("Intents:", intents)
print("Entities:", entities)
```

### 3. **Speech Synthesis**
Using the `pyttsx3` library for text-to-speech (TTS) allows us to provide dynamic spoken responses.

```python
import pyttsx3

def speak(text):
    engine = pyttsx3.init()
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()

# Example usage
speak("Hello, I am JARVIS. How can I assist you today?")
```

### 4. **Task Automation (Email Handling)**
We can use the `smtplib` library to send emails. Here is a basic email-sending function.

```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def send_email(to_email, subject, body):
    # Set up the email
    from_email = "your_email@gmail.com"
    password = "your_password"
    
    msg = MIMEText(body)
    msg["Subject"] = subject
    msg["From"] = from_email
    msg["To"] = to_email

    # Send the email
    server = smtplib.SMTP_SSL("smtp.gmail.com", 465)
    server.login(from_email, password)
    server.sendmail(from_email, to_email, msg.as_string())
    server.quit()

# Example usage
send_email("recipient@example.com", "Meeting Reminder", "Don't forget about the meeting at 3 PM.")
```

### 5. **Smart Home Control**
We can integrate with smart home systems using APIs like Home Assistant. Here's an example using the Home Assistant API.

```python
import requests

def control_smart_device(entity_id, action):
    url = "http://your-home-assistant-url/api/services/homeassistant/turn_on"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your_access_token",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    data = {
        "entity_id": entity_id
    }
    if action == "off":
        url = "http://your-home-assistant-url/api/services/homeassistant/turn_off"
    
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Device control successful")
    else:
        print("Failed to control device")

# Example usage
control_smart_device("light.living_room", "on")
```

### 6. **Web Scraping and Information Retrieval**
We can use `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping, or use an API like `requests` for real-time data retrieval.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def get_weather(city):
    url = f"https://www.weather.com/weather/today/l/{city}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
    
    # Scrape weather data
    weather = soup.find("span", class_="CurrentConditions--tempValue--3KcTQ").text
    return weather

# Example usage
weather = get_weather("San Francisco,CA")
speak(f"The current temperature in San Francisco is {weather}.")
```

### 7. **System Monitoring**
Using `psutil` to monitor system performance.

```python
import psutil

def get_system_stats():
    cpu_usage = psutil.cpu_percent()
    memory_info = psutil.virtual_memory()
    disk_info = psutil.disk_usage('/')
    
    return {
        "CPU Usage": cpu_usage,
        "Memory": memory_info.percent,
        "Disk Usage": disk_info.percent
    }

# Example usage
stats = get_system_stats()
print(stats)
```

### 8. **Facial Recognition and Emotion Detection**
We'll use `OpenCV` for facial recognition and `deepface` for emotion detection.

```python
import cv2
from deepface import DeepFace

def recognize_face():
    # Load the face recognition model
    video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
    
    while True:
        ret, frame = video_capture.read()
        cv2.imshow('Video', frame)
        
        # Perform face recognition (you can add your custom logic here)
        try:
            face_data = DeepFace.analyze(frame, actions=['emotion'])
            print(face_data)
        except:
            pass
        
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    video_capture.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Example usage
recognize_face()
```

### 9. **Emotion Recognition**
We'll integrate voice-based emotion detection using `librosa` or `tensorflow` models for more advanced emotion analysis.

### 10. **Learning and Adaptation**
This would involve storing user preferences and adapting responses based on previous interactions. You could use machine learning models for recommendation systems, combined with a local database like SQLite.

### 11. **Multimodal Interaction**
This would require integrating Tkinter for the GUI, allowing users to interact with voice, text, and buttons. Here's a simple Tkinter setup:

```python
import tkinter as tk

def send_command():
    user_input = entry.get()
    print(f"Command received: {user_input}")
    # Process command...

root = tk.Tk()
root.title("JARVIS Assistant")

entry = tk.Entry(root, width=50)
entry.pack()

button = tk.Button(root, text="Send", command=send_command)
button.pack()

root.mainloop()
```

### 12. **Security**
Implementing security features like encryption and biometric authentication would involve more advanced techniques like using `cryptography` for data encryption and enhancing the facial recognition code for security.

### Conclusion
This is just a high-level overview and code snippets to get you started on each requirement. Building a fully functional JARVIS-like assistant in Python involves combining these components into a unified system, with robust error handling, concurrency, scalability, and security. 

If you want to focus on a specific feature or dive deeper into a particular module, feel free to ask!

### Instructions

1. **Weather API**: Make sure to replace `"your_api_key"` and `"your_location"` with your actual Weather API key and location.
   
2. **Face Recognition**: Implement the face recognition functionality using OpenCV or a similar library if needed.

3. **Additional Features**: Extend the `handle_command` function with more commands based on your requirements.

4. **Error Handling**: Add additional error handling and testing as necessary.
